		<p>This image displays that voter frequency is somewhat connected to education and income variables. 
            The graphic reflects that most people with at least some sort of college 
            education vote at least on occasion. The proportion of people who rarely/never vote steadily increases in  
            prominence as the amount of income decreases. </p>
        <p> The connections between education and income levels are by no means automatically related, not every 
            single person with a college education is in the highest income category and there are a small number of people with
            a high school education that also belong to the $125k or more category. However, general trends reveal that 
            the majority of people with this highest income level do have a college degree. Conversely, the other two
            education levels, some college or high school, are more sporadic in the amount that their individuals earn. 
            There are several ribbons from each of these lower education categories that connect to each income level, indicating that
            the difference between some college (but still lacking a college degree) and high school education levels is
			marginal. </p>

        <p>The bubble plot below visualizes data that displays the relationship between the percentage of absentee ballots and 
            percentage of actively registerd individuals who turned out to vote from 2014 to 2022. It is notable that 
            The data for the year 2020 looks particularly different from the others in that the percentage of absentee 
            ballots was dramatically higher than in the other years. </p>

		<p>There are notable differences in overall voter turnout between the years 2016 and 2020, with the percentage of actively
			 registered people who voted in both years dramatically inflated compared to other years. In the year 2014 
			 the percentage of registered people who voted fell between 30% and 60%. The year 2022 was not 
			 much more impressive with the highest turnout percentage barely closing in on 65% in Rappahannock County 
			 (Northern region). Voter turnout percentages recorded for 2018 were a bit higher with most counties falling within 
			 the 50%-70% range including some outliers that produced even higher percentages. However the years 2016 and 
			 2020 display that the percentage of actively registered people who voted was 
			 higher, with the median and mean of 2016 falling somewhere around 70%-75%, and 75% for the year 2020.
